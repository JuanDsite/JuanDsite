## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel, a tech explorer and systems engineer student at the Francisco JosÃ© de Caldas University, based in BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
Who Am I?

    As a programmer, I focus on writing clean, maintainable and scalable code, always respecting good programming practices. As a cybersecurity analyst, I enjoy identifying vulnerabilities in systems and     
    applying strategies to protect them. As I grow as a software developer, I continue to hone my skills to deliver solutions that meet both functional and security requirements. Additionally, as an advocate 
    of free software, he actively supports open source principles and collaborates to foster a community of shared knowledge.

    
ðŸ“« Reach out to me for collaborations, discussions on security, or anything related to free software in two years!

Happy coding :)
